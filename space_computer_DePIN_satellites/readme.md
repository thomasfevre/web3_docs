**What is SpaceComputer?**
SpaceComputer is a space-based digital sovereignty layer built as a cryptographically secure compute protocol for applications across the blockchain stack.

Each node in the network is a Space Trusted Execution Environment (SpaceTEE). The hardware infrastructure layer is based on satellites equipped with “crypto engines” and data modules, serving as the decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) in orbit.

SpaceComputer architecture features a two-layer system: the Celestial Chain in space, serving as the ultimate authority for immutable data history, and the Uncelestial layer on Earth for fast transaction pre-finality. This brings high security guarantees based on tamper-resistant hardware orbiting in the isolated space environment, ensuring resilience even during terrestrial network outages.

SpaceComputer was founded by a team of experienced software and hardware researchers, entrepreneurs, and developers with expertise in both space and blockchain technology. The project aims to enable a space-native economy, envisioning a future where commerce and computation extend beyond Earth, supported by its innovative satellite-powered blockchain network.

**cTRNG (cosmic True Random Number Generator)**: Employs data from cosmic radiation, detected via satellite instrumentation, to produce unbiased, cryptographically secure random numbers.
